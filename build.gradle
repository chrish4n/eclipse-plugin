/**
 * This buildfile is used to build a complete distribution archive of the gradle eclipse feature
 * The gradle eclipse feature contains two eclipse plugins:
 * 1. org.codehaus.gradle
 *	This plugin wraps a complete gradle distribution in a eclipse/osgi plugin and exports the gradle libs in its manifest to be
 *	reused by other osgi plugins
 *
 * 2. org.gradle.eclipse
 *	This plugin contains all logic, extension points and implementations to extend the eclipse ide. 
 *	By default it imports the gradle-api exported via org.codehaus.gradle
 *
 * To build this gradle eclipse plugin the following steps should be implemented in this build file:
 *	1. copy org.coehaus.gradle and org.gradle.eclipse to a build working directory.
	2. resolve a matching gradle distribution and merge it into the org.codehaus.gradle plugin skeleton.
	3. update the import/export statements in the osgi manifests of org.gradle.eclipse and org.codehaus.gradle
	4. resolve a eclipse distribution to run the pde build (actual we're using eclipse-sdk-3.5.2)
	4. run the pde build to
		- build a valid eclipse plugin archive
		- create a update site
		- run tests
